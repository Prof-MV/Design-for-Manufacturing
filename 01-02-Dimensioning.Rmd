### Learning Objectives {-}

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Apply fundamental dimensioning rules according to ASME Y14.5 standards
- Select appropriate dimension placement for clarity and manufacturability
- Use proper extension lines, dimension lines, and leaders
- Dimension common features including holes, arcs, and angles
- Avoid common dimensioning errors

**Before You Read:** Look at any mechanical part near you. How would you
communicate its exact size to someone who needs to manufacture it? What
measurements would be most important?

### Introduction to Dimensioning

Dimensioning is the process of adding size and location information to
engineering drawings. Proper dimensioning ensures that parts can be
manufactured exactly as the designer intended.

**Industry Connection:** In the defense industry, improper dimensioning can
have serious consequences. A famous example is the Mars Climate Orbiter, which
was lost due to a unit conversion error. Clear dimensioning standards prevent
such costly mistakes.

### Key Takeaways {-}

- Dimensions should be placed for maximum clarity
- Each dimension should appear only once on a drawing
- Dimensions should relate to functional requirements
- Standard symbols and conventions ensure universal understanding

**Quick Check:** What is the difference between an extension line and a
dimension line? Why is it important not to dimension to hidden lines?
