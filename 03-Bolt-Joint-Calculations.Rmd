# Strength of Bolt Joint Calculations

Mechanics of Bolted Joint Integrity {#bolted-joints} Bolted joints are among the most common elements in mechanical design, yet they are often the most frequent points of failure. Ensuring the strength of a bolted joint requires a delicate balance between the physical properties of the bolt, the stiffness of the clamped members, and the applied external loads. Fundamentals of Bolt PreloadWhen a bolt is tightened, it undergoes axial extension, creating a clamping force known as preload ($F_p$). This preload is essential because it keeps the joint members in compression, preventing separation and reducing the amplitude of cyclic loading on the bolt itself. 
The relationship between the applied torque ($T$) and the resulting preload is typically approximated by the "short-form" torque equation:$$T = K \cdot D \cdot F_p$$
Where: $T$ is the tightening torque.$K$ is the torque coefficient (often ~0.2 for unlubricated steel).$D$ is the nominal diameter of the bolt. $F_p$ is the desired preload. Note: Relying solely on torque to determine preload is notoriously imprecise due to friction variables. Advanced applications may use the "turn-of-nut" method or ultrasonic tension sensors [@shigley2020]. Load Distribution and Joint Stiffness. When an external tensile load ($P$) is applied to a joint, only a fraction of that load is actually felt by the bolt. The rest is absorbed by the decompression of the clamped members. This is defined by the joint stiffness constant, $C$:$$C = \frac{k_b}{k_b + k_m}$$ In this equation, $k_b$ represents the stiffness of the bolt and $k_m$ represents the stiffness of the members. The total force acting on the bolt ($F_b$) after the external load is applied is:$$F_b = F_p + C \cdot P$$ Visualizing Factor of Safety to ensure the joint does not fail via yielding or separation, we must calculate the factor of safety. The following R code demonstrates how the bolt force increases relative to the external load until the point of joint separation.

```{r bolt-plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Relationship between Bolt Force and External Load."}
library(ggplot2)
library(rlang)
library(vctrs)

# Parameters
preload <- 5000  # Newtons
C <- 0.25        # Stiffness constant
ext_load <- seq(0, 10000, by = 100)

# Calculate Bolt Force
# Before separation: Fb = Fp + C*P
# After separation: Fb = P (once P > Fp/(1-C))
sep_point <- preload / (1 - C)
bolt_force <- ifelse(ext_load < sep_point, preload + C * ext_load, ext_load)

df <- data.frame(ExternalLoad = ext_load, BoltForce = bolt_force)

ggplot(df, aes(x = ExternalLoad, y = BoltForce)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2c3e50", linewidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = sep_point, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  annotate("text", x = sep_point, y = max(bolt_force), label = "Joint Separation", 
           hjust = 1.1, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Bolted Joint Load Response",
       x = "External Applied Load (N)",
       y = "Total Force on Bolt (N)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

As illustrated in Figure ~\@ref(fig:bolt-plot), the bolt force increases much more slowly while the joint is clamped ($C < 1$). Once the external load exceeds the separation point, the bolt must carry the entire load, significantly increasing the risk of fatigue or tensile failure. 

**Summary Checklist for Designers**

* Determine required clamping force to prevent sliding or separation.
* Select bolt grade based on proof strength requirements.
* Calculate stiffness-es ($k_b, k_m$) to find the joint constant.
* Verify safety factors against yielding, joint separation, and fatigue.

## Definitions and Background

Key Terminology  used to describe the geometry of a bolt.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Thread Standards"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ThreadStandards.png")
```

* **Pitch** – distance between adjacent threads.	Reciprocal of  threads per inch.
* **Major diameter** – largest diameter of  thread
* **Minor diameter** – smallest diameter of  thread
* **Pitch diameter** – theoretical diameter between major and minor diameters, where  tooth and gap are same width

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Basic Thread Profile"}

```

> **Note:** The dimensions and geometry in the figure above are only used for drawing the threads, they are not dimensions to manufacture to!

The tensile stress area, $A_t$, is the area of an unthreaded rod  with the same tensile strength as a threaded rod.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Tensile Stress Area"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/TensileStressArea.png")
```

It is the effective area of a threaded rod to be used for stress  calculations.  
The diameter of this unthreaded rod is the average of the  pitch diameter and the minor diameter of the threaded rod.

:::{.question}
##### **1)** What is the spring constant of the bolt $k_b$? {-}
:::

::: {.answer}
The bolt stiffness ($k_b$) is calculated using the following formula:

$$k_b = \frac{A_d A_t E}{A_d l_t + A_t l_d}$$

Where the individual parameters are determined as follows:

**Length of the unthreaded portion ($l_d$):**

$$l_d = L - L_T = 1.5 - (2 \cdot 0.5 + 0.25) = 0.25 \text{ in}$$

**Length of the threaded portion ($l_t$):**

$$l_t = 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.095 - 0.25 = 1.095 \text{ in}$$

**Tensile stress area ($A_t$):**

$$A_t = 0.1599 \text{ in}^2$$

**Major diameter area ($A_d$):**

$$A_d = \frac{\pi}{4}(0.5)^2 = 0.1963 \text{ in}^2$$

**Modulus of elasticity ($E$):**

$$E = 29 \cdot 10^6 \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}^2}$$

Substituting these values back into the main formula for $k_b$:

$$k_b = \frac{0.1963 \cdot 0.1599 \cdot 29 \cdot 10^6}{0.1963 \cdot 1.095 + 0.1599 \cdot 0.25} = 3.57 \cdot 10^6 \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}}$$
:::

::: {.question}
##### **2)** What is the spring constant of the compressed joint $k_m$? {-}
:::

::: {.answer}
**Spring Rate of Compressed Joint Case : $3D_{head} < D_{joint}$**

The area $A_s$ is given by the formula:
$$ A_s = \frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \left[ (D_H + 0.1 l_j)^2 - D_h^2 \right] $$

Given values:
$$ D_h = 0.510 \, \text{in} $$
$$ D_H = W \text{ on Page 8} = 1.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.75 \, \text{in} $$
$$ l_j = 0.5 + 0.75 + 0.095 = 1.345 \, \text{in} $$
where $l_{j}$ is the entire joint length.

Substituting the values into the area formula:
$$ A_s = \frac{\pi}{4} \left[ (0.75 + 0.1 \cdot 1.345)^2 - 0.510^2 \right] = 0.4102 \, \text{in}^2 $$

The stiffness $k_j$ is calculated as:
$$ k_j = \frac{E A_s}{l_{material}} $$
where $l_{material}$ is the length of the substitute cylinder of each material.

* **Steel Spring Constant**
Length for steel, combine top plate and washer:
$$ l_{steel} = 0.5 + 0.095 $$

Stiffness for steel:
$$ k_{steel} = \frac{29 \cdot 10^6 \cdot 0.4102}{(0.5 + 0.095)} = 20 \cdot 10^6 \, \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}} $$


* **Cast Iron Spring Constant**
Given values for cast iron:
$$ E = 13 \cdot 10^6 \, \text{psi} $$
$$ l_{cast iron} = 0.75 $$

Stiffness for cast iron:
$$ k_{iron} = \frac{13 \cdot 10^6 \cdot 0.4102}{0.75} = 7.1 \cdot 10^6 \, \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}} $$

* **Combine springs in series:**
The equivalent spring constant $k_m$ is found using:
$$ \frac{1}{k_m} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2} + \dots + \frac{1}{k_n} $$

Substituting the calculated stiffness values:
$$ \frac{1}{k_m} = \frac{1}{20 \cdot 10^6} + \frac{1}{7.1 \cdot 10^6} = \frac{1}{1.908 \cdot 10^7} $$

Solving for $k_m$:
$$ k_m = 5.24 \cdot 10^6 \, \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}} $$

**Spring rate of compressed joint:**
$$ k_m = 5.24 \cdot 10^6 \, \frac{\text{lbf}}{\text{in}} $$

::: {.question}
##### **3)** What is the initial load in the bolt $F_i$? {-}
:::

::: {.answer}

##### Joint Stiffness Constant (C) {-}
The stiffness constant **C** defines how the external load is shared between the bolt and the clamped members:
$$ C = \frac{k_b}{k_b + k_m} = \frac{3.57 \cdot 10^6}{3.57 \cdot 10^6 + 5.24 \cdot 10^6} = 0.405 $$


##### Load and Preload Parameters {-}
* **Portion of Load (P):** The external load shared by the individual fastener:
    $$ P = \frac{10000 \text{ lbf}}{4} = 2500 \text{ lbf} $$
* **Initial Preload ($F_i$):** Calculated based on the *Fastenal Technical Reference Guide*[@fastenal_guide]:
    $$ F_i = 0.75 \cdot 0.1599 \cdot 85000 = 10194 \text{ lbf} $$
:::

::: {.question}
##### **4)** What is the tensile force in the bolt $F_b$? {-}
:::

::: {.answer}

##### Resulting Forces {-}
**Force in the Bolt ($F_b$):**
The total tension in the bolt after the external load is applied:
$$ F_b = C \cdot P + F_i $$
$$ F_b = 0.405 \cdot 2500 + 10194 = 11207 \text{ lbf} $$
:::


::: {.question}
##### **5)** What is the compression force in the members $F_m$? {-}
:::
::: {.answer}

**Force in the Member ($F_m$):** The force remaining in the clamped members:
$$ F_m = (1 - C) \cdot P - F_i $$
$$ F_m = (1 - 0.405) \cdot 2500 - 10194 = -8707 \text{ lbf} $$

> **Note:** The negative result for $F_m$ indicates that the members are in **compression**.

:::{.question}
##### **6)** Tensile Stress in Bolt  {-}
:::
::: {.answer}

The following calculations determine the tensile stress and various safety factors for the bolt assembly.

**Tensile Stress ($\sigma_b$):**
$$\sigma_b = \frac{F_b}{A_t} = \frac{11207}{0.1599 \, in^2} = 70 \, ksi$$

:::
:::{.question}
##### **7)** What are the safety factors $n_L$, $n_P$, $n_O$?   {-}
:::
::: {.answer}
**1. Proof Load Safety Factor ($n_p$):**
$$n_p = \frac{S_p A_t}{CP + F_i} = \frac{85000 \cdot 0.1599}{0.405 \cdot 2500 + 10194} = 1.21$$

**2. Load Factor ($n_L$):**
$$n_L = \frac{S_p \cdot A_t - F_i}{CP} = \frac{85000 \cdot 0.1599 - 10194}{0.405 \cdot 2500} = 3.36$$

**3. Separation Safety Factor ($n_o$):**
$$n_o = \frac{F_i}{P(1 - C)} = \frac{10194}{2500(1 - 0.405)} = 6.85$$

:::

:::{.question}
##### **8)** Torque Requirements and Lubrication Effects  {-}
:::
::: {.answer}

This question evaluates the torque required to achieve the initial tension ($F_i$) and the impact of lubrication on bolt integrity.

**Torque required to achieve $F_i$:**
$$T = K \cdot d \cdot F_i$$
$$T = 0.2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 10194 = 1019 \, in \cdot lbf = 85 \, ft \cdot lbs$$

> **Note:** ($in \cdot lbf$) are not common units. Therefore answer in ($ft \cdot lbs$) instead.

**Impact of Lubrication ($K = 0.1$):**
What is $F_i$ if the operator lubricates the bolt?
$$F_i = \frac{T}{K \cdot d} = \frac{1019}{0.1 \cdot 0.5} = 20380 \, lbf$$

**Resulting Stress ($\sigma$):**
$$\sigma = \frac{F_i}{A_t} = \frac{20380}{0.1599} = 127454 \, psi$$

> **Conclusion:** The stress exceeds tensile strength! \
> **Result:** Bolt will break while tightening.
